  <h1>OAuth 2.0 Callback</h1>
  <p>You have been redirected back to the application.  Check the URL for authorization information.</p>

  <script>
    // This is a placeholder.  In a real application, you would:
    // 1. Parse the URL to get the authorization code or error message.
    // 2. Send the authorization code to your server.
    // 3. Your server would exchange the authorization code for an access token.
    // 4. Store the access token securely.
    // 5. Redirect the user to the main application page.

    // For demonstration purposes, we'll just display the URL:
    alert("Full Callback URL: " + window.location.href);
